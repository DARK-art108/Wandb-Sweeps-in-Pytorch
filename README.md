## WanDB Sweeps and Hydra Configration for Pytorch

### What you can find in this repository?

**Task That are Done in this repository:**

- [x] Modularized the Pytorch Code, now you can adapt this code to your own computer vision task[majorly Image Classification]
- [x] Added a simple example to show how to use the code on CIFAR100 dataset
- [x] Added logging using loguru

**Task that are upcoming in this repository:**

- [ ] Will add wandb support for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and model saving
- [ ] Add Hydra for Configration Management
- [ ] Torch Profiler for measuring cpu and memory consumption
