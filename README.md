### What you can find in this repository?

**Task That are Done in this repository:**

- [x] Modularized the Pytorch Code, now you can adapt this code to your own computer vision task **(majorly Image Classification)**
- [x] Added a simple example to show how to use the code on CIFAR10 dataset
- [x] Added logging using loguru
- [x] Wandb Integration Done, Experiments are logged on wandb and can be accessed from the wandb dashboard

**Task that are upcoming in this repository:**

- [ ] Wandb Sweeps
- [ ] Add Hydra for Configration Management
- [ ] Torch Profiler for measuring cpu and memory consumption
